# Tax-Collector
Discord bot made to automate tax collection in the game Albion Online

## Available commands:
- taxes <ammount>
- afk <mention> <duration> <reason>

## Usage
### Taxes
Before using the taxes command go into you game and press "G". There you'll find two icons next to the search bar, click the first one with the 3 vertical lines. Click the "Timeframe" dropdown and select last week. Now that the logs have loaded click the icon directly above the scroll bar which will copy the contents of the logs to your clipboard. Now you can head back to discord and type in the respective channel "afk 100000" and press CTRL+V which will paste the logs. Now hit ENTER and go back into the game again. Once back in click on the dropdown that says "Tax Contribution" and select "Silver Balance". Now repeat the same proccess as before but leave the discord message empty and hit ENTER, the rest is self explanatory.
If you want the bot to message everyone on the list and give them a reminder to pay their taxes you need to click the Check Mark emoji on the message.
